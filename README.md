# Voyager

[![Matrix](https://img.shields.io/matrix/orbit-db%3Amatrix.org)](https://app.element.io/#/room/#orbit-db:matrix.org) [![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40orbitdb/voyager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbitdb/voyager) [![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/%40orbitdb/voyager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbitdb/voyager)

A **storage service** for [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb) peer-to-peer databases.

Voyager replicates and stores OrbitDB databases and makes them available to others when the database's originating peer is offline.

It is designed to run on systems with guaranteed uptime and public availability and can be seen as a "data availability node" for OrbitDB. For example, a browser-based app running a OrbitDB database may rely on one or more Voyager peers to ensure the database is available when the browser peer is unreachable.

***Note!*** *This software is currently in alpha version status and thus may change, break backwards compatibility or contain major issues. It has not been security audited. Use it accordingly.*

## Installation

To use Voyager as a module:

```sh
npm i @orbitdb/voyager
```

To use Voyager from the CLI:

```sh
npm i -g @orbitdb/voyager
```

## Usage

### CLI

The `voyager` CLI tool can be used to manage a Voyager instance. Run `voyager` on the command line to get started.

Currently the following commands are available:

```
voyager daemon   Launch Voyager
voyager id       Show the voyager's id
voyager address  Show the voyager's network addresses
voyager auth     Add or remove authorized user
```

### Daemon

Voyager can be run as a daemon process. You can install the package globally and run it using the `voyager` CLI binary:

```sh
voyager daemon
```

To store Voyager's configuration and data to a different directory, use the `-d` or `--directory` flag or `VOYAGER_PATH` environment variable:

```sh
voyager daemon -d /path/to/voyager
```

```sh
VOYAGER_PATH=/path/to/voyager voyager daemon
```

#### Command Line Options

Voyager daemon supports several command line options:

**Help**
- `--help, -h`: Shows command line help

**Port Configuration**
- `--port, -p`: The port to listen on for the libp2p TCP transport. Defaults to 0 (random available port).
- `--wsport, -w`: The port to listen on for WebSockets. Defaults to 0 (random available port).

**IP Address Announcement**
- `--ip4`: Specify IPv4 address to announce to the network (e.g., `--ip4 "37.27.185.96"`)
- `--ip6`: Specify IPv6 address to announce to the network (e.g., `--ip6 "2a01:4f9:c013:cc9::1"`)

**Logging**
- `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose logging. Use multiple times (e.g., `-vvv`) for increased verbosity.

**Access Control**
- `--allow, -a`: Allow anyone to add a database. The default is false (deny all except explicitly authorized users).

**Auto-TLS Configuration**
- `--staging, -s`: Use Let's Encrypt staging environment for auto-TLS certificates. Useful for testing certificate provisioning. Defaults to false (production environment).
- `--disable-auto-tls`: Disable automatic TLS certificate provisioning. Defaults to false (auto-TLS enabled).

**Metrics**
- `--metrics, -m`: Enable metrics collection and reporting. Defaults to false.

**Storage Location**
- `--directory, -d`: Specify a directory to store Voyager, IPFS, and OrbitDB data. You can also use the `VOYAGER_PATH` environment variable.

**Example with multiple options:**
```sh
voyager daemon -p 9090 -w 9091 -vvv -s --allow --metrics
```



### Docker

You can run an Voyager storage service using a pre-configured Docker image.

Once you have cloned this repo, cd into the voyager directory root and run:

```
docker build -t orbitdb-voyager ./
docker run --rm -d -p 8000:8000 orbitdb-voyager
```

Adjust the port if required.

## Managing Voyager Access

Voyager will deny all requests by default. To allow a user to interact with Voyager, the (requesting) user's `id` must be added to Voyager's "allow" list.

Access can be configured in two ways; from the terminal and programmatically, using RPC.

**NOTE** The user's `id` used in the examples below can be retrieved using **`orbitdb.identity.id`**, which is available from the user's OrbitDB instance.

### Managing access from the terminal

To add an authorized user to Voyager:

```sh
voyager auth add <id>
```

where `<id>` identifies a user who can add databases to this Voyager instance. The `<id>` is the string from user's OrbitDB instance `orbitdb.identity.id`.

To remove an authorized user from Voyager:

```sh
voyager auth del <id>
```

where `<id>` identifies a user who can add databases to this Voyager instance. The `<id>` is the string from user's OrbitDB instance `orbitdb.identity.id`.

List authorized users:

```sh
voyager auth list
```

If Voyager is deployed to a custom directory, call Voyager with the `-d` or `--directory` flag, or `VOYAGER_PATH`environment variable, and specify the directory:

```sh
voyager auth add -d /custom/voyager/path <id>
voyager auth remove -d /custom/voyager/path <id>
voyager auth list -d /custom/voyager/path
```

```sh
VOYAGER_PATH=/custom/voyager/path voyager auth add <id>
VOYAGER_PATH=/custom/voyager/path voyager auth remove <id>
VOYAGER_PATH=/custom/voyager/path voyager auth list
```

### Managing access using RPC

Authorizing users can be carried out programmatically using Voyager's RPC function.

Start by instantiating the rpc:

```
import { RPC } from '@orbitdb/voyager'

const rpc = await RPC({ directory: '' })
```

To add an authorization:

```
const id = '037ba2545db2e2ec0ba17fc9b35fbbf6bc09db82c9ab324521e62693e8aa96ceb4'
await rpc.authAdd({ id })
```

To list all authorizations:

```
const { message } = await rpc.authList()
console.log(message)
```

And to remove an authorization:

```
await rpc.authDel()
```

## Adding databases to Voyager

To make databases accessible from a Voyager storage service, the database needs to be added to a Voyager instance. This can be achieved programmatically by using the **Voyager remote API** module.

To use Voyager remote API, first install the [@orbitdb/voyager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbitdb/voyager) package:

```sh
npm i @orbitdb/voyager
```

Next, instantiate Voyager remote API:

```js
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { createHelia } from 'helia'
import { createOrbitDB } from '@orbitdb/core'
import { Voyager } from '@orbitdb/voyager'

// set up libp2p, helia and orbitdb
const libp2p = await createLibp2p()
const ipfs = await createHelia({ libp2p })
const orbitdb = await createOrbitDB({ ipfs })

// deployed voyager peer's listening address, it looks like this:
// /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/54322/p2p/16Uiu2HAmATMovCwY46yyJib7bGZF2f2XLRar7d7R3NJCSJtuyQLt
const address = '...'

const voyager = await Voyager({ orbitdb, address })
``` 

To add a database to voyager:

```js
// create a db to be added to voyager
const db = await orbitdb.open('my-db')

// add the address to voyager (can also pass an array of addresses)
await voyager.add(db.address)
```

To remove a database from voyager:

```js
// open an instance of the db you want to remove from voyager
const db = await orbitdb.open('my-db')

// remove the address from voyager (can also pass an array of addresses)
await voyager.remove(db.address)
```

## The OrbitDB Voyager Protocol

Voyager uses Libp2p to add and remove databases to replicate to and from the storage service. A database can be added or removed by dialling the protocol and issuing a request message.

### Protocol

The protocol identifier is:

```
/orbitdb/voyager/v1.0.0
```

### Messages

Send one of the following messages to the protocol in order to communicate with the service:

#### Adding a DB for replication

```
type: 1 ("ADD")
id: The id of the requester
signature: One or more database addresses signed by the requester
addresses: One or more database addresses to add to the storage 
```

If successful, an OK response will be sent. If it fails, an error will be returned.

#### Removing a DB for replication

```
type: 2 ("REMOVE")
id: The id of the requester
signature: One or more database addresses signed by the requester
addresses: One or more database addresses to remove from the storage
```

If successful, an OK response will be sent. If it fails, an error will be returned.

## Allowing and Denying User Access

Voyager uses simple ALLOW/DENY policies to authorize the messages received through the protocol.

Voyager can either be run in ALLOW ALL mode where anyone can send a message except those who appear in the denied list or DENY ALL mode which will only allow messages from an explicit list of users. The default access mode is DENY ALL.
